# Angular 9/Ivy + i18n: Empty main.js.map when built in watch mode

## üêû bug report

### Affected Package

The issue is caused by Ivy.


### Is this a regression?

Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: Angular 8


### Description

In Angular 9 when building a localized bundle in watch mode with, e.g., `ng build --configuration=de --watch` the created main.js.map SourceMap is just an empty object.

Not sure if this is a bug or just a missing feature, but I couldn't find any documentation about it.

When Ivy is disabled in tsconfig.json the SourceMap is built as expected. The problem also doesn't occur with `ng serve`.


## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction

LINK

This is just a minimal 'repro-app' with i18n configuration as described in the Angular docs.

To reproduce the error run `ng build --configuration=de --watch` and inspect the empty main.js.map SourceMap in dist/repro-app/de.
